## SECTION B

### Introduction

Our idea for our project is a mobile application that can be used for expos in Dublin City University. The application would feature an interactive map where users can see easily see where project demonstrations are located. They can press on the booth/stall to see more information about the project and its details.

### Outline

A mobile application designed to replace or supplement the current Project Expo booklet. This application would include a map which would allow the users to easily locate where each of the project demonstrations are located. The map would be interactive meaning users can click onto a project which would then take them to a page or side menu containing the project information such as its description, project area, project technology, member details and their supervisors. The map can then be cleared after the expo has been completed and be repurposed for a future expo meaning it can be reused. The app will also contain a list featuring all the projects in the expo. When a user clicks on a project from the list, it will lead them to the location of the project demo.

### Background

This idea was originally thought of by Dr. Jennifer Foster with the intention of replacing or supplementing the current DCU Project Expo booklet.

### Achievements

The mobile application will feature functions such as an interactive map where a user can select on a booth/stall that opens a page or sidemenu to gain more information on the project about its details. It will also feature a list of all the projects so a user can select a project and find out the location of where it is being demonstrated. It will also feature a function where the projects can be cleared from the venue and be replaced for a future expo. This project is inteded for users such as expo attendees.

### Justification

This mobile application will intend to help expo attendees on locating a project demonstration or gaining more information on a project on a mobile device instead of a physical booklet. This will reduce the time the user has to flip through a booklet and instead use their mobile device to locate or know more about the project they are interested in. This application will be useful during an expo on campus. The user or expo attendee can easily download this application and use it while walking around the expo.
